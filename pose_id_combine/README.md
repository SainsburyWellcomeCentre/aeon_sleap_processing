# Pose and ID Combining

## Overview
This directory contains tools for generating predictions with trained pose and ID models, and combining them into a single consistent dataset.

## Workflow
1. **[Generate SLEAP Predictions](step1_generating_SLEAP_predictions/README.md)**
   - Apply trained models to experiment videos using Bonsai
2. **[Combine ID and Pose Predictions](step2_combining_SLEAP_predictions/README.md)**
   - Match identity detections to pose detections
   - Output combined tracking data for analysis

## Next Steps
Your combined tracking data is ready for analysis!
